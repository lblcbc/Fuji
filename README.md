# Fuji: A new focus.

Fuji aims to help re-energize productivity and focus. With tailored customizability, smart text recognition, and cross-device syncing, Fuji helps you get more done with less. All these features can be accessed with your subscription, which also helps make the planet a greener place, so that together we can grow. Simple. beautiful. impactful. start for free now https://apps.apple.com/ch/app/fuji-a-new-focus/id6446494130?l=en.

This was a nice little project using SwiftUI, hoping to both get better at the Swift lanugage, as well as have a small impact in the process üåçüå±. While I massively enjoyed the process from start to finish, Fuji: A new focus. is unlikely to receive any major new updates, given time constraints, and being personally satisfied with the project (for now at least...). 

I do hope however that sharing this code allows the app to live on a little bit longer ‚Äì perhaps aiding other like-minded people looking to build a SwiftUI app, as the goodwill of other coders invaluably guided me throughout this project. The app is fully functional (approved and published on the App Store as validation ;)) (with the compatibilities stated below), and packs some pretty cool features (see below üëÄ); that said, being my first complete-to-distribution Swift/UI project, I end with the small disclaimer that I am not a pro (yet - you gotta start somewhere üìà).

### Highlight features of the app:
* An app compatible for iPhone (iOS 16), iPad (iPadOS 16), and Mac (macOS 13)
* Light mode and dark mode, along with smooth production-ready animations and useability
* Focus analytics (time in focus, tasks completed)
* Beautiful UI and UX, with wide customisability, and of course, haptics on iOS iPadOS üòå
* Privacy att the core
* Coded entirely in Swift/SwiftUI, and fully compliant with App Store Review Guidelines (April 2022)

### Super-highlight features:
* Extra smart ü§ì: Type recognition to automatically set deadlines, both on a date level (ex. tomorrow, end of month (eom)) and time-level (ex. morning, midday, etc)
* Allows for reccuring tasks, weekly or monthly
* Create, edit, focus and complete tasks efficiently (some nice custom-model array code)
* Real-time (seriously üòé) cross-device syncing
* Fully optimised (practically) database reliance with Firebase Firestore (aka, safe to scale with very low costs)
* Sign in With Apple integration, connected to Firebase Auth
* Connected with RevenueCat API for app-subscriptions

Main thing I would update:
* Move date and time of day retrieving code line into functions where it's needed, rather than initialising once for that view. This fixes the minor task organisation issues when app isn't "refreshed" for a long time.
