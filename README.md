This was a nice little project using SwiftUI, hoping to both get better at the Swift lanugage, as well as have a small impact in the process üåçüå±. While I massively enjoyed the process from start to finish, Fuji: A new focus. is unlikely to receive any major new updates, given time constraints, and being personally satisfied with the project (for now at least...). 

I do hope however that sharing this code allows the app to live on a little bit longer ‚Äì perhaps aiding other like-minded people looking to build a SwiftUI app, as the goodwill of other coders invaluably guided me throughout this project. The app is fully functional (approved and published on the App Store as validation ;)) (with the compatibilities stated below), and packs some pretty cool features (see below üëÄ); that said, being my first complete-to-distribution Swift/UI project, I end with the small disclaimer that I am not a pro (yet - you gotta start somewhere üìà).

### Highlight features of the app:
* An app compatible for iPhone (iOS 16), iPad (iPadOS 16), and Mac (macOS 13)
* Light mode and dark mode, along with smooth production-ready animations and useability
* Focus analytics (time in focus, tasks completed)
* Beautiful UI and UX, with wide customisability, and of course, haptics on iOS iPadOS üòå
* Privacy att the core
* Coded entirely in Swift/SwiftUI, and fully compliant with App Store Review Guidelines (April 2022)

### Super-highlight features:
* Extra smart ü§ì: Type recognition to automatically set deadlines, both on a date level (ex. tomorrow, end of month (eom)) and time-level (ex. morning, midday, etc)
* Allows for reccuring tasks, weekly or monthly
* Create, edit, focus and complete tasks efficiently (some nice custom-model array code)
* Real-time (seriously üòé) cross-device syncing
* Fully optimised (practically) database reliance with Firebase Firestore (aka, safe to scale with very low costs)
* Sign in With Apple integration, connected to Firebase Auth
* Connected with RevenueCat API for app-subscriptions
