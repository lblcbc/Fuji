This was a nice little project using SwiftUI, hoping to both get better at the Swift lanugage, as well as have a small impact in the process üåçüå±. While I massively enjoyed the process from start to finish, Fuji: A new focus. is unlikely to receive any major new updates, given time constraints, and being personally satisfied with the project (for now at least...). 

I do hope however that sharing this code allows the app to live on a little bit longer ‚Äì perhaps aiding other like-minded people looking to build a SwiftUI app, as the goodwill of other coders invaluably guided me throughout this project ‚ò∫Ô∏è.
